    data_extraction_rules.xml - Rules for Android 12+ data transfer

    This file defines rules for transferring app data when:
    - User upgrades to a new device
    - Cloud backup/restore
    - Device-to-device transfer

    For beginners: This tells Android what app data should be backed up.
    We include everything since we don't store sensitive data.
