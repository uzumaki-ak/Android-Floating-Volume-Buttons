    device_admin.xml - Device Administrator policy definition

    This file declares what device admin capabilities our app needs.
    In our case, we only need the "force-lock" capability to lock the screen.

    For beginners: Device Administrator is a special Android permission
    that allows apps to perform system-level actions. This XML file
    tells Android exactly what capabilities we need.
